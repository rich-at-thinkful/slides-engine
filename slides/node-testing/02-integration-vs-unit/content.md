# Integration vs. Unit Testing

<div class="row">
<div class="cell-4">

**Unit tests** check that each individual piece of our code works correctly. 

But even if each component of your code works well in isolation there may still be errors at the interface between components. The interface is a shared boundary across which components exchange data. {.fragment data-index="1"}

**Integration tests** are designed to uncover errors that occur during this communication. {.fragment data-index="2"}
