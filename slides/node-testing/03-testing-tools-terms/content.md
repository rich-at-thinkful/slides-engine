* **Testing structure** - The scaffolding within which tests are run. E.g. Mocha, Jasmine, Jest
* **Assertion functions** - Used to assert conditions for passing tests. E.g. Chai, Jasmine, Jest
* **Watchers** - Generate results and watch for code changes to redo the tests. E.g. Mocha, Jest, Karma, Jasmine
* **Snapshots** - Generate and compare snapshots of components. E.g. Jest, Ava
* **Mocking** - Fake certain modules or behaviors to test only part of a process. E.g. Jest, Enzyme, Sinon, Jasmine
* **Spies** - Observes a function and provides details about how that function is invoked without affecting the behavior of the function. E.g. Sinon
* **Stubs** - Like spies, but replaces the function allowing you to control the behavior of a function during tests. E.g Sinon
* **Code coverage** - Automatically determines which lines of code are covered by tests and gives a report. E.g. Istanbul, Jest
