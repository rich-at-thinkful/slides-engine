# Assignment

<!-- * Snapshot Testing - Qualified Coding Challenge -->
* Build a React Profile Page
    * Create additional components that are then used by the App component.
    * Do not assume anything about the list lengths. Your app should accommodate different values for the variables (name, birthday, imageSrc, hobbies, dailyActivities)
    * If the hobbies list is empty, you should display nothing for hobbies.
    * If the dailyActivities list is empty, you should display nothing for the schedule.
    * Style the components using inline styling and/or CSS files. It does not need to match the appearance of the example image, but should have a reasonable layout.
    * Include a snapshot test for each component.
