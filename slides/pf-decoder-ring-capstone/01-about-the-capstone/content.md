# About the capstone

* Build three algorithms which allows you to encode/decode secret messages
* Write tests for each algorithm
    * Think about the edge cases: what can go wrong with the input and output?
* Aim to complete one algorithm/set of tests each day, with Thursday set aside for polishing up, and working on an extension exercise
