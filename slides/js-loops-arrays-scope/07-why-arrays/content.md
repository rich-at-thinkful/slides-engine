# Why arrays?

* An example
    * You are in charge of 10 employees
    * You need their sales record to find out if each employee's sales is above or below average
* One solution
    * Create 10 separate variables to represent the sales of 10 employees
    * Assign values to each (10 assignment statements)
    * Calculate the average: `average = (sales1 + sales2+ sales3 + ....)/number of employee`
* What if your employee count increases to 50
    * 50 separate variable declarations and assigning values?
