# Variable scope

* Scope defines the area of a program in which a variable is visible
* Variables have a lifetime
    * When the lifetime ends, the variable goes to the garbage collector (and is inaccessible)
* Global scope
    * Variable visible from all scopes
    * Variable lifetime is the entire length of the program
* Local scope
    * Variable visible inside the function only
    * Variable lifetime ends when function finishes executing
