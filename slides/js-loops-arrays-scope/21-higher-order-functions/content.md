# Higher-order functions

* In JS functions are values - just like string and numbers
* Can you pass string or number as a parameter to another function? YES
    * Therefore, you can pass functions as parameter to another function
* Can you return a string or a number? YES
    * Then you can return a function as well
* Can you assign a string or number to a variable? YES
    * Then you can assign a function to a variable
* Functions which work with other functions
    * We're through the looking glass here people
* Two types of higher-order function
    * Functions which take a function as an argument
    * Functions which return a function
        * This creates a **closure**
