# The project

* Create an application for an animal shelter which allows adoption of cats and dogs.
* There are the only two types of animals in the shelter, cats and dogs.
* The adoption process works strictly on a first in-first out basis.
* People can choose to adopt either a cat, a dog, or both.
* People can **only** adopt the pets who have been at the shelter for the longest.
