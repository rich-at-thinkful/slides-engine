# Recursion

* Recursive functions are useful for working with self similar problems
    * Recursion is used for tasks that can be defined as similar subtasks
* Recursion reduces a problem to smaller, similar, problems that can be solved more easily than the larger problem.

### How would you write a function that counts down?

<div class="row">
<div class="cell-2">

```js {#countdown-code}
countDown(5)
```

</div>

<div class="cell-2"></div>

<div class="cell-2">

```bash {#countdown-output}
5
4
3
2
1
```

</div>
</div>

<div class="line line-arrow-end" data-from="countdown-code" data-to="countdown-output">
