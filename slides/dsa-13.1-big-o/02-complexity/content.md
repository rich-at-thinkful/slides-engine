# Algorithm complexity

<div class="small">

* A measure of how much of a resource an algorithm uses as a function of the size of the input data
* Can look at one of two things:
    * Time complexity: how the number of operations required scales with the size of the input data (most common)
    * Space complexity: how the memory requirements scale with the size of the input data
* Commonly represented using big O notation
    * "O" indicates the order of growth (i.e. is it constant, linear, exponential etc.)
* Can be worked out in three different cases:
    * Worst-case: Think of the most difficult type of input for the algorithm to process
    * Best-case: Think of the simplest type of input for the algorithm to process
    * Average-case: If we took all of the possible inputs, how long would the average one take
