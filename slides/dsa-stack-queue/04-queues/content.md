# Queues

* First-in, first-out (FIFO)
* Operations are done at both ends of the queue
* Like a queue for food - you join the back of the queue, and get food when you're at the front
* Ways to implement it:
    * Linked list with a head and tail pointer
    * Ring buffer
        * Array with a head and tail pointer, which wrap at the ends
