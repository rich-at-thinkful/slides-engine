# Stacks

* Last-in, first-out (LIFO)
* All of the work is done at the top of the stack
* Like a stack of plates: you take the top place, or add a new plate to the top
* Ways to implement it:
    * Linked list with a tail pointer
    * Array
* Important part of how programming languages work
    * The variables which you create are stored in a stack
    * Variables going out of scope are popped from the stack
