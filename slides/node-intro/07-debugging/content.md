# Using a Debugger

* Debugging is the process of fixing issues in your code
* You can use commands like `console.log` to output values at specific points in runtime, but this isn't the only tool available
* Visual Studio Code has a built-in debugger that allows you to pause and resume code execution
* Examine values held in variables at any moment in execution!
* Watch control flow step-by-step

### Pausing

* Add a **breakpoint** in your debugger
* Add the command `debugger;` into your code
