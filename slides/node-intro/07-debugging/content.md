# Using a Debugger - NDB

* Debugging is the process of fixing issues in your code
* You can use commands like `console.log` to output values at specific points in runtime, but this isn't the only tool available
* A debugger like **NDB** allows you to pause and resume code execution examining values held in memory at any point

### Pausing

* Add a **breakpoint** in your debugger
* Add the command `debugger;` into your code
