# Final Capstone Requirements

### Frontend requirements
* Use React along with the API that you built as part of the final capstone.
* Your app must be responsive and work just as well on mobile devices as it does on desktop devices.
* You may use vanilla CSS or Bootstrap for styling the frontend.
* The styling on your client must be polished.
