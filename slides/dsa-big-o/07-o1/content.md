# O(1) - Constant time

```js
// What is the maximum number of operations for any array length?
// What if I want the nth element?  Does the runtime change?
function getFirstItem(array) {
    return array[0];
}
```

* An algorithm with a O(1) or constant order of growth has a fixed number of operations
* The running time doesn't depend on the size of the input
* Examples: arithmetic operations, array indexing, object property access
