# Maps vs. Objects

They feel similar but have nuanced differences

* Objects are a construct with special behaviors, like prototypal inheritance, and the root data type of JS functions and arrays
* Maps are intended as a "simpler," pure data structure that just hold keys and values, similar to a hash or dictionary in other languages
* Keys in maps can be any data type; keys in objects must be strings or Symbols
* Maps iterate through keys in order of insertion
* Maps have a size property
